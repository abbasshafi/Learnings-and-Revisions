Pydantic:
Imagine you're running a restaurant, and you have a menu with specific dishes listed. Pydantic helps you ensure that when customers order food (send requests to your API), they provide the right information in the right format.
In short, Pydantic makes sure that the data coming into and going out of your FastAPI-based service is correct and well-organized, just like a reliable restaurant assistant helps keep orders accurate and organized in a restaurant.
