Test error vairies greatly by selection of training data points and this is called high variance bcz of high variability in the test error.
overfit model === high variance

variance:
the differnce of fits on different datasets 
low difference of error means low variance








Bias: high assumptions
The inability of machine learning model to truly capture the relationship in the training data 


overfit:
good on train data but not good on test data
low bias and high variance


underfit: 
cannot capture relationships in training data


ways to get balance fit model:

ensemble
cross validation
regularization
PCA
