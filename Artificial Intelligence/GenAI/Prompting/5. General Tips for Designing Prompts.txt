1. You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as "Write", "Classify", "Summarize", "Translate", "Order", etc.
2. Another recommendation is to use some clear separator like "###" to separate the instruction and context.
3. The more descriptive and detailed the prompt is, the better the results.
4. Another common tip when designing prompts is to avoid saying what not to do but say what to do instead.
